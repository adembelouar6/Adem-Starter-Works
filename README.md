# ✨ Adem-Starter-Works
A collection of my very first steps into C++ programming.  
Each code snippet represents a small milestone in my learning journey 🚀.

## 📂 Code 1: Basic Input/Output (learn_cpp_first_code)  
This program:
- Asks the user for basic personal information 👤
- Prints it back to the console 🖥️  

## 📂 Code 2: Player Stats Tracker (learn_cpp_second_code)  
This program:
- Lets the user enter a player's name, age, energy, years spent, and energy consumed 🎮
- Calculates and shows updated age and remaining energy 🔢
- Prints all player stats nicely in the console 🖥️  
👉 We'll keep updating and improving it with every new upload!
