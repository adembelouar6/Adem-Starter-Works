# ✨ Adem-Starter-Works  
A collection of my very first steps into C++ programming.  
Each code snippet represents a small milestone in my learning journey 🚀.  

---

## 📂 CODE 1: BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT (`learn_cpp_first_code`)  
This program:  
- Asks the user for basic personal information 👤  
- Prints it back to the console 🖥️  

---

## 📂 CODE 2: PLAYER STATS TRACKER (`learn_cpp_second_code`)  
This program:  
- Lets the user enter a player's name, age, energy, years spent, and energy consumed 🎮  
- Calculates and shows updated age and remaining energy 🔢  
- Prints all player stats nicely in the console 🖥️  

---

## 📂 CODE 3: PLAYER STATS ADVENTURE (`learn_cpp_third_code`)  
This program:  
- Lets the user enter a player's name, level, health, mana, and score ⚔️  
- Updates stats using arithmetic operations, increment/decrement, and shorthand operators 🔧  
- Calculates a small bonus using modulus `%` 🎁  
- Displays all updated player stats clearly in the console 🖥️

## 📂 CODE 4: COMPARISON & LOGICAL OPERATIONS (`learn_cpp_fourth_code`)  
This program:  
- Asks the user for **age, energy, and level** 📊  
- Uses **comparison operators** (≥, ≤) and **logical operators** (||) ⚖️  
- Decides and prints messages depending on the conditions 🖥️  
- Represents my **first practice with `if / else` statements** ✍️✅

## 📂 CODE 5: ADVANCED CONDITIONS (`learn_cpp_fifth_code`)  
This program:  
- Asks the user for **age, energy, and level** 📊  
- Uses multiple `else if` blocks, and advanced condition checking 🧩  
- Prints different messages depending on the player's stats 🎮  
- Strengthens my practice with **conditional logic** 🔑  
- 📅 Date: *Friday, September 26*

## 📂 EXTRA: SWITCH STATEMENT (`learn_cpp_fifth_code_extra`)  
This extra file:  
- Demonstrates the **switch statement** as a complement to conditional logic 🔀  
- Allows selection between multiple options depending on a variable  
- `case` checks specific values, `break` stops execution after a match, `default` works like `else`  
- Strengthens practice with **decision-making structures** 🧩  
- 📅 Date: *Sunday, September 28*

## 📂 CODE 6: AFRICANA TRAINING CAMP (`learn_cpp_sixth_code`)  
This program:  
- Asks the user for the **total number of players** 🎮  
- Uses a **for loop** to read each player's **name, age, energy, and level** 📝  
- Applies **conditions**:  
  - If player is under 18 → ❌ not allowed  
  - If age ≥ 18, energy ≥ 50, and level > 5 → ✅ ready for Africana  
  - Otherwise → needs more training  
- Tracks and displays the **player count** after each entry 🔢  
- Represents my **first real practice with loops + conditions combined** ✍️💪
